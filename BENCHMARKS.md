# OpenCompiler Performance Benchmarks

This document presents benchmarks comparing OpenCompiler's optimized code against baseline implementations across various models and hardware platforms. These benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our architecture-specific optimizations, particularly on Apple Silicon hardware.

## Methodology

All benchmarks were conducted using the following methodology:
- Each model was run for 100 warm-up iterations followed by 1,000 timed iterations
- Results show the mean execution time with 95% confidence intervals
- Memory usage was measured as peak memory consumption during inference
- Tests were run on clean systems with minimal background processes
- Power measurements were collected on systems with power monitoring capabilities (where available)

## Hardware Platforms

Benchmarks were performed on the following hardware:
- **Apple M1 Pro** (10-core CPU: 8 performance cores, 2 efficiency cores)
- **Apple M2 Ultra** (24-core CPU: 16 performance cores, 8 efficiency cores)
- **Intel Core i9-12900K** (16 cores: 8 P-cores, 8 E-cores)
- **AMD Ryzen 9 7950X** (16 cores, 32 threads)
